Product Name: OpportuniTea (WIP)

Slogan:
Job hunting can sour your mood when you are looking for a job with no practical experience under your belt. With 
OpportuniTea, we can turn those bitter experiences into smooth and enriching ones by giving you the confidence and the 
knowledge to land your first job. It's as simple as making a cup of tea.

Product Description:
Our group aims to create a service based in the Ottawa area that gives engineering
students in university and college the edge when trying to get in the job market.
Our service offers mentors that have real-job experience from their chosen profession,
giving them field-specific tips and mentoring that would allow them to gain an edge when applying for jobs
in their fields of study. Additionally, students who undergo the mentoring service can also
access our team's list of business contacts in the Ottawa area. Students could
pitch themselves and their skills to our network of businesses that are looking to hire
prospective engineering students.
